Project for the Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies (A.Y. 2022-2023). The aim is to create a blockchain based decentralized app using [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/).

2Pack have the purpose to help the people to deliver packs in a secure and not expensive way. In fact an user can create a post with a pack to send, an other user can accept to deliver the pack and propose itself as delivery. When a delivery man completes the shipment on time, he will receive the prizes offered by the post, otherwise he will receive a penalty for each day of delay or for having lost the package.
Any step is guaranteed by the blockchain.
